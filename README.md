Hello.
Anyways, the player script includes:

-Bobbing (Hands)
-Bobbing (Camera)
-Smooth movement
-A janky system that handles various animations for the player (in the project the player can swing around a pickaxe)
-Momentum? (not really, however I tried recreating it.)


This is how the player is structured, you can ignore "cursor" that is the crosshair, "grain" that is a shader "hitboxes" and "RayCast3D" that are only to detect if the weapon is hitting something.
SORRY if the code is a bit messy, this whole thing is kinda rushed.
